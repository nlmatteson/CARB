# California Electrification Incentive Claims
#### This folder holds the .py files I used to clean CEDARS data to only keep claims that relate to fuel switching (task complete) and combinging the CEDARS data with the TECH data (still in the works)

## Data Sources:

#### CEDARS: https://cedars.sound-data.com/reports/record-level/ 
I individually downloaded each year (2016 - 2022). You can download all files at once, but my computer was taking too long to process it. The filtering process is the same for each year, so if you do chose to download them all at once, the process is the same.
